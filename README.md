Recona mainly is a website that identifies the cellular composition of tissues and chromosomes for cells to help doctors detect Lynch syndrome. People with this syndrome are at risk of developing various types of cancers, they are advised that early identification will significantly speed up treatment and reduce risk.
Users of recona can access the platform anytime, anywhere, and receive fast and meticulous service. The website will serve all doctors, bioinformaticians, and bioinformatics students. the main scope is to identify the cellular composition of tissues and chromosomes and detect lynch syndrome mutation.

The website serves anyone with an interest in what it offers including clinicians, bioinformaticians, and researchers. The website will provide better options for users to search and manipulate their sequence so that they can know the type of tissue they are working on, know the chromosome and discover if the owner of the genetic sequence has Lynch syndrome. This genetic disorder increases the risk of many types of cancer, especially colon cancer and endometrial cancer. Thus, predicting a patient's risk of developing these cancers is possible.
